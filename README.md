# Voidcalls, Horror Mod for B1.7.3 (StationAPI)

-blah blah blah blah, blah blah blah

Inspired by Mark101.

Inspired by The Broken Script by Wendigodripp.

Thank you to Dany for letting me use Tropimodel and Tropimodelrenderer, which helped greatly in the process of adding in custom entity models. And also NyaLib which allowed me to make multiple things function on multiplayer!

An absolutely huge thank you to Dairycultist who is responsible for implementing Adminspace, and whose advisement in this mod also has kept me trying to develop it!

# Todo list below!



## Entities

### Nearsighted (DONE!)

-Model/Textures (done? A little buggy, im gonna beg Dany to help me understand Tropimodels.)

-Animations (done)

-AI mechanics (Finished, except for taking you to solitude.)

-Ghost no texture blocks that spawn randomly in the air.

-Exponentially small spawn rate so it's actually a surprise to see one.

-Walking/getting chased into touching Nearsighted takes you to the Solitude dimension which is similar to the skylands/aether but the islands are huge and more flat and stack ontop of each other. Made entirely out of bedrock blocks. Sky is dim and it is very difficult to see. You must drop down far enough to land in the "blocks" and you get sent back to your respawn anchor.

### Subjugate/Integrity (UNIMPLEMENTED)

-Model/Textures (W.I.P. Textures, possible workaround for 64x32 limit to make a faithful integrity texture being brainstormed.)

-Animations (done.)

-AI mechanics-Supposed to chase you down and make your screen flash black with red text and play messages in chat. Is deliberated hostile. Intended to kill you, if you are on a server will kick you from the game after youre killed with a message saying "err.nevercomeback"

-Leaves behind an err.integrity block wherever it was standing when it locks onto a player.

-Spawn only underground for the dwelling version, and not the hidden variant which will not be listed yet. Must only spawn in low light conditions, must be exceptionally rare as to not completely ruin mining/underground dwelling.

-Many noises to be implemented, too complicated to explain circumstances.

-Can escape by letting it be agro for 14 seconds and have it not kill you or anyone else, it will then disappear.

### Fuse (UNIMPLEMENTED)

-Model/Textures (Unimplemented but finished)

-Animations (done.)

-AI Mechanics-Will not move, will spawn randomly and stalk player from a distance. If you look at it, it will play the moon error sound and disappear.

-Spawn only above ground. Not ultra rare, just ment to put a player on edge without hurting them.

-Will never despawn until you look a it.

### Null (UNIMPLEMENTED)

-Model/Textures (Unimplemented but finished)

-Animations (done.)

-Ai Mechanics-Will run at players at very high speeds, can break doors but only doors. Must be agro'd by going close to it, before then it just stands there watching similar to Fuse. Will instantly kill player that agros it then disappear. 

-Spawn same as Fuse.

-In agro mode, will pose many threats in chat in chase mode, and thunder will chase behind it rapidly.

-Will disappear if damaged in any way.

### Angel (DONE! :D)

-Model/Textures (Same issue as Integrity/Subjugate)

-Animations (whole entity will simply shake a little very fast.)

-Ai Mechanics-Will stalk player by watching from a distance, if a player looks at its hitbox too long it will run after the player at high speeds. Can scale 4 blocks. Will not break anything, but can pass through 1 block gaps. Will do large amounts of damage, but will not insta-kill.

-Spawn same as Nearsighted.

-If killed drops adminspace block, similar to bedrock but can be broken by explosions.

-Will never disappear until you survive by being chased for 30 seconds or die in its chase.

### Herobrine (UNIMPLEMENTED)

-Easter egg

-Will spawn in caves only, lowest light level.

-Exceptionally rare

-Will not move or hurt the player, will disappear 4 seconds after the player touches it hitbox. Will follow the eyes of the player.

### Fake Markus (UNIMPLEMENTED)

-Steve model that has been hue'd a little black.

-glitched animations

-When the player comes within 10 blocks of it, it will set lightning to them and give them a piece of paper named "you will become one of us" 1/4 chance of Subjugate spawning in place of Markus 10 seconds later.

-Spawns in low light level environments.

-Never despawns.

### Duck (UNIMPLEMENTED)

-Secretttt :3



## Basic mechanics 

-The only way to damage entities is using explosive arrows from Elemental Arrows as a soft dependency, without the mod it is impossible to fight them and you must learn to evade them effectively.

-All entities will spawn at least 50 blocks away from each player.

-All entities will have individual sound cues.

-Ideally, this mod will work the same on servers and single player worlds.

-Config will provided to enable/disable events/entities.



## Blocks (Done, but with quirks)

-adminspace block, unbreakable except for explosions.

-adminspace.light block, same as adminspace block.

-err.texture block, magenta and black checkered cube. Player can walk through.

-err.integrity block, which is adminspace block with err on it.



## Sounds (Mostly done.)


All sounds are W.I.P. but are original except for the moon error, which is from the mark101 ARG.



## Events

-Occasionally a sign will spawn saying something

-Occasionally, a village named tiny town will spawn

-Occasionally, the church of integrity will spawn. Custom blocks are TBD.

-Occasionally, a notch village will spawn with signs inside that say "go. away."

-Occasionally, sounds will play with no meaning other than induce anxiety.

-Occasionally, a red stone torch will be placed next to a players spawn anchor, finding the nearest air block.

-Occasionally, the player will be sent to a maze dimension made entirely out of adminspace and adminspace.light blocks. DONE HAHAHAH TY CULTIST :D

-Occasionally, a large chunk of err.texture blocks will spawn in the sky.

-Occasionally, chat messages (client only, maybe?) will appear on your screen.
